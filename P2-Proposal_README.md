## Project 2 Proposal
### For Team CRYVESTO_2.0

---

For Project 2, team Cryvesto 2.0 seeks to construct a Machine Learning(ML) Sentiment Trade Bot(STB) that utilizes market sentiment from news and social media sources that responds to ‘Bullish’ or ‘Bearish’ signals. The Bullish or Bearish signals trigger an entry or exit point to trade targeted securities or assets. We will then compare the ML_STB with traditional technical indicators using SMAs for DMAC signals that trigger entry and exit points, as well as different algorithm classification models. 

We believe that our evaluation comparison highlights the importance of ‘fear’ and ‘greed’ that influences market forces, which could be leading indicators for trade points. When utilized from the aggregated database metrics, signals are generated in response to ‘fear’ and ‘greed’ to place trades.
