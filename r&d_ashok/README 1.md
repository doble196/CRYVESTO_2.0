    "## User Story\n",
    "A retail trader is so innundated with world news, business news, political events that he is unable to keep track of how these might impact trading. To help bring some sanity to this process, we are designing a bot which will utilize ML techniques and train the model with a sentiment analysis and how it impacted trading in the past. Use this knowledge to predict given the current news should an investor buy a stock or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The bot is capable of handling any stock symbol. If you give a particular stock symbol, it is going to utilize ML to give the best possible answer for that stock symbol\n",
